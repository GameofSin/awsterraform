# awsterraform
This is a terraform code to help you build a vpc, ec2s, and IAM users.
Of course I am always editing this repo and adding more to it

-EC2: Is mostly made to be dynamic with multiple instances and designed for autoscaling.

-VPC: Just a regular vpc with the subnets and routetables.

-IAM: Lets you create an IAM user with password
